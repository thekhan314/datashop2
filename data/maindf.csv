0,1876 Reserve,Rated 4.3 out of 5, Based on 513 Ratings ,"Even gramps would be proud.On a trip to factories in the Dominican Republic some time ago, I was offered a boatload of a really nice, smooth handmade called 1876 Reserve. I’m guessing the manufacturer either drank too much Dominican rum or his abacus was busted. Don’t get me wrong, I certainly ain’t complaining because I think under normal circumstances it would’ve cost me twice as much to buy what I bought (I better remove his name from the mailing list so he doesn’t see this later). What I do know is that this is an incredibly mellow Dominican cigar that’s well worth our ridiculous 2-fer price. In fact, the buy-in here starts under two bucks apiece! Is that too cheap? Maybe it’s me that’s getting soft in the head. Oh well, if you like easy going cigars, you’ll love this deal.",Mellow,"['Churchill', 'Robusto', 'Toro', 'Torpedo']",Sumatra,Dominican,False,No,More Details,Dominican Republic,No,,"Churchill, Robusto, Toro, Torpedo",No,Connecticut,
1,1876 Reserve Maduro,Rated 4.19 out of 5, Based on 247 Ratings ,"A dark horse from 1876 Reserve.Maestro....drumroll please. And now, without further delay, enter 1876 Reserve Maduro. That's right, the fan-favorite 1876 Reserve now comes draped in a dark, juicy maduro wrapper leaf. The profile is still relatively tame, yet the darker, richer leaf adds a welcomed layer of complexity. And better yet, the price is exactly the same, right around two bucks apiece. I don't like taking credit when it's not due, but I definitely deserve a pat on the back for this one. Well-made Dominican lovelies stuffed with aged Dominican long-fillers and sporting a toothy maduro wrapper, all for pennies on the dollar.

Made in one of Honduras’ top factories? Check. Handsome packaging? Check. Toast the foot and take a draw. You’ll see some spirit up front: a slight nutty taste followed by some zesty peppery notes on the back of the palate. A feisty sucker!

While there, Rafael discovered an aging process for wine, beer, and brandy called… you guessed it, the “Solera” process. And being the tobacco man he was, Nodal couldn’t wait to apply this unique aging process to premium cigars. Enter Solera: a full line of premiums from Aging Room, featuring four distinct wrappers and unique flavors across the board. The Aging Room Solera Sun Grown is a medium-bodied iteration of the blend. Once lit, you’ll find notes of maple, slight nuttiness, and a citrusy zest. It’s a bright a lively cigar, one that performs beautifully on its own, but just does as well with a nice glass of rum or bourbon to accompany it. Picking a favorite in this line would be a tough choice: but Sun Grown is certainly in the conversation. ",Medium,"['Figurado', 'Robusto']",Dominican,Dominican,False,No,More Details,Dominican Republic,No,,"Figurado, Robusto",No,Sun Grown,Aging Room Cigars

And Alec & Bradley Blind Faith is the first blend they have created on their own.It starts out with a deep brown Habano wrapper grown in Trojes, Honduras. Underneath is a double binder combination from Honduras and Nicaragua that creates a sturdy, slow burning cigar. The meat is a three-leaf combination or Nicaraguan long-fillers.

Available in two varieties - a thick and leathery Habano and a dark, oily Maduro - Cain utilizes superior long-leaf ligeros from Nicaragua’s three major growing regions: Esteli, Condega, and Jalapa. The cigar is eventful and complex, delivering a full-bodied, full-flavored assortment of deep, hearty flavors in smooth fashion. Hearty spices mingle with a deep tobacco core and Cuban-esque qualities, smacking the palate with notes of earth and coffee along the way. The abundance of thicker ligero leaves provide a slower burn, allowing you to truly appreciate each long-lasting puff, as the cigar grows more intense in both flavor and strength toward the nub.The newer Cain ‘F’ is a bold new Nicaraguan blend, a stout addition to the family which delivers a full-throttle array of heady, satisfying flavors.

Yet it’s unexpectedly smooth and balanced with a deep, rich flavor profile featuring notes of spices, earth, leather and coffee. Slow-burning, complex and robust, Cain ‘F’ sets a new benchmark in extra-full-bodied handmades.Cain Habano 'F' received a well-deserved 92-point rating, noting:""Solidly rolled with a dark, oily and attractive wrapper. The draw is bit firm, but instantly delivers rich, bold notes of leather and spice that intensify in both flavor and body.""As if that wasn't enough, Cain Habano received a '90' rating, commenting:""This toothy torpedo wears an oily wrapper.

While the Long Live The King blend was one of Caldwell’s most full-bodied releases, Savages takes it back a notch, falling in the middle of the spectrum. But the flavor is still there, in true Caldwell fashion, this cigar is incredibly rich, complex, well-balanced, smooth and enjoyable any time of day.

In a monumental revamping effort, Camacho created the “Board of the Bold,” a star-studded cast of brand directors including Mike Ditka, Matt Booth, and the person behind the BG Meyer Company, Rob Weiss. Rob Weiss is well-known in the cinema industry as one of the writers and producers on the hit HBO series, “Entourage!” I never heard of him, but he’s got a Wikipedia…and that’s proof enough for me. Plus, the cigar’s pretty damn tasty. So that’s that. BG Meyer’s Standard Issue stays true to the “Board of the Bold” name, delivering a medium-full bodied experience. A true gem, rare Dominican fillers are nestled within a Dominican binder.

And I couldn’t wait to share it with the world.The blend starts with Camacho’s famous original Corojo tobacco, aged patiently in the beer-soaked bourbon barrels for a minimum of 6 months.

It was only a matter of time before a follow-up was announced. And lucky for all of us CAO fans, turns out that this Amazon experiment is bound for a trilogy! Enter phase two: CAO Fuma em Corda, a full-bodied blend like no other. The word “unique” gets thrown around a lot. But here, it’s the real McCoy. The tobacco used in the Fuma em Corda is bound by tightly wound ropes and left to ferment, a technique native to the tobacco farmers of Brazil. The Braganca tobacco inside undergoes a different process — compressed and fermented for six months into tightly wound tubes. Add a Honduran Oscuro wrapper and Cameroon binder and you’ll find a woody flavor, with spiciness and an incredibly long finish. Our recommendation?

316,CAO Orellana,Rated 5 out of 5, Based on 2 Ratings ,"From deep within the amazon, to deep within the aging room.In 2014, CAO announced a mysterious new cigar that piqued the collective interest of the cigar world. That cigar was the Amazon Basin, and utilized a special leaf in the filler known as Braganca. This rare tobacco is grown in patches of available sunlight in the Amazon, before being hand-rolled into tubes and rowed in canoes to the factory. This cigar spawned two offshoots, all using varying types and amounts of Amazonian tobacco and all selling out relatively quick. Now CAO is completing the series with the Orellano, the name given to the Amazon by explorer Francisco de Orellana. Despite this being the fourth cigar in the Amazon series, the Orellana’s Brazilian Cubra wrapper has been patiently aging since before CAO even discovered the Braganca used in the original. Cubra grows smaller, darker, leaves than most plants, and produces a pleasantly spicy, complex profile. The exotic wrapper is joined by a Nicaraguan binder and fillers from the Dominican & Colombia, with a healthy amount of Brazilian Braganca and Fuma Em Corda to ensure this cigar tastes like nothing you’ve ever had before.

Now with their new release, CAO Pilon, they are resurrecting a seldom used and costly fermentation method, the circular pilon. A standard tobacco pilon is basically a pile of tobacco ‘hands,’ which are 10-15 tobacco leaves tied together, that are allowed to heat up and ferment. With a circular pilon the hands are carefully layered in a circular pattern, with the payoff being that the tobacco ferments at a slower rate which enhances the flavor.CAO Pilon comes dressed in a dazzling Ecuador Habano wrapper, encasing the binder and long-fillers from Nicaragua.

If you're looking for something outside of your norm, we suggest indulging in your own Mistress experience.   ",Full,"['Corona Gordo', 'Gordo', 'Robusto', 'Toro']",Pennsylvania Broadleaf,Pennsylvania,False,,More Details,Nicaragua,False,,"Corona Gordo, Gordo, Robusto, Toro",False,Ecuador Habano,

From what we eat and drink, to running around like mindless ants to get to where we're going. We're all victims of 'normal'. But at the end of the day, normal can get boring, fast. That's where cigar companies like Crowned Heads come into play. Influenced by the edgy, rebellious, and determined lyrics of the band, Kings of Leon, Crowned Heads goes against the programming of everyday handmades. Without further adieu, enter their first creation, Four Kicks cigars. Their motto is simple, yet loud and clear. Stick to who you are, stay loyal to those you care about, and never forget where you came from.Crafted under the watchful eye of E.P. Carrillo in the Dominican, Four Kicks brings the substance in spades. At first glance, it's easy to think of this is as a powerhouse cigar. But a closer look reveals a medium-bodied cigar bursting with flavor. It all starts with a smooth, reddish-brown Ecuador Habano wrapper. This leaf is seamlessly applied to a core of Nicaraguan long-fillers hugged by a Nicaraguan binder. From the first puff, the senses are met with a wave of chewy, spicy-sweet flavors. Nuts, leather, and a steady dose of pepper join forces with creamy, cedary undertones. There's a lot going on, but one thing is for sure. It works, and works well. Complex, interesting, and one eye-catching handmade, this should be on your to try list.

Their first blend, Four Kicks, was a huge success, and now they’ve re-blended the original release with master blender Ernesto Perez-Carrillo Jr. Offered up in the same four sizes as the original Four Kicks release, this darker retelling of the Crowned Heads story is most certainly worth checking out. It all starts with a toothy and rustic Connecticut Habano maduro wrapper leaf that gives off tons of cocoa and chocolate aromas as soon as you remove the cellophane.

The folks over at Crowned Heads are  sticking to their musically themed cigar lines and have decided to honor Cash with their newest release, Jericho Hill. One of the most influential American singer/songwriters of all time, Johnny’s checkered past compelled him to perform one of his most famous tracks –  Cocaine Blues, from his renowned concert at Folsom Prison. This is the ballad of a scorned man named Willy Lee whose drug induced rage got him arrested by a sheriff from Jericho Hill. Every aspect of this cigar takes inspiration from the song.Jericho Hill boasts a dark and sultry Mexican San Andres wrapper, which is a nod to both Juarez, Mexico, where Willy Lee was arrested, and to Johnny’s nickname, “Man in Black.” Nicaraguan long-fillers and a Nicaraguan binder help to give Jericho Hill some serious attitude (just like Johnny had). Stuffed to the brim with blasts of pepper, spice, and leather, this is one full-bodied firecracker. Only the most potent of blends would suffice in paying tribute to a legend of Johnny Cash’s stature, and this one fits the bill.

475,Diesel Whiskey Row,Rated 4.63 out of 5, Based on 76 Ratings ,"Diesel LibationIf you’ve been around these parts long enough, you’re well aware of the Diesel brand. No-nonsense, full-flavored, and expert construction. These phrases no doubt come to mind. Diesel Whiskey Row stays true, but takes a unique approach for the brand. The binder is aged in Rabbit Hole Bourbon barrels – a first for Diesel as well as master blender AJ Fernandez. But have no fear – these bourbon barrels that once held Rabbit Hole Bourbon were first shipped to AJ Fernandez in 2016. After many months of testing, he finally nailed down a process that imparts the perfect amount of flavor and aroma into the tobacco and Diesel Whiskey Row was born. The core of this cigar is made up entirely of Nicaraguan long-fillers from 3 different growing regions - Ometepe, Jalapa, and Condega – that have been aged from five to eight years. The bourbon barrel aged binder is a Mexican San Andres leaf, and it’s all held together five-years aged Ecuadorian habano wrapper. The barrel aging produces a strong oaky flavor and hints of bourbon in the aroma. You’ll also notice some floral notes, spice and some sweetness in a medium-bodied format. In my many, many samplings of this cigar, the construction has been nothing short of flawless – something we’ve come to expect from AJ-made cigars. Grab a box of these unique Diesels today, pair ‘em with a few fingers of the good stuff, and you won’t be disappointed. Good news!

Yes, the second stop on the Don Rafael world tour is sure to be a favorite for those who like their cigars hearty. Add in the fact that you’re getting filet quality at burger shack pricing, and you’ve got a no-brainer on your hands. Let’s get the first question out of the way here — why is there an Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper on a cigar named Brasil. Well, dig in a bit deeper and you’ll find you answer. The Brazilian leaves in this blend come from the binder and filler, the right place for them to shine through. They add a nice “oomph” to the otherwise mellow wrapper leaf, resulting in a medium-bodied experience that’s got a perfect yin-yang of spicy, sweet, and tangy.

The infused line of ACID cigars is a perennial best seller. And their traditional cigars have been praised by all the critics. When Willy Herrera joined team DE in 2013, he created the Herrera Esteli line and then followed it up with Herrera Esteli Norteno.

516,Drew Estate Herrera Esteli Habano,Rated 4.5 out of 5, Based on 2 Ratings ,"Big Willy Style....Welcome Herrera Esteli cigars, the newest addition to join the ranks of Drew Estate's massive portfolio. As with the Liga and Undercrown lines, Herrera Esteli further solidifies Drew Estate's presence in non-infused, traditional cigars. This time, the story starts with Willy Herrera. He was a tobacco guru at the famed El Titan de Bronze factory in Miami, responsible for some of the most sought after and highly-rated handmades around. And once he combined forces with Drew Estate, he took like a duck to water. What you see here is the result of sampling and tweaking dozens upon dozens of blends, and the final process is as close to perfection as you can get. From the vintage Cuban-esque bands to the cabinet style box, Herrera Esteli screams Cuba. And the glue sealing the whole thing together is the blend. Oh-so-creamy, yet highly representative of Cuban cigars of old. It's got some oomph, but the flavors are delivered in such a velvety fashion the power is beautifully masked. Crisp, clean notes of spices, cedar, cream, and roasted nuts are the backbone, as occasional hints of white pepper and semi-sweet vanilla weave masterfully throughout. Initial puffs foreshadow a medium-bodied profile, but the slow burn begins to unveil a different story, as it inches toward a medium to full-bodied crescendo. If the Liga Privada series is a cup of black coffee, Herrera Esteli is without a doubt the ""with cream"" option.

517,Drew Estate Herrera Esteli Miami,Rated 4 out of 5, Based on 1 Rating ,"More Herrera from MiamiDrew Estate has an impressive portfolio of cigars. From the infused ACID line to the traditional wares like Liga Privada and Undercrown, everything coming out of La Gran Fabrica Drew Estate in Nicaragua competes with the best in the industry. One of their finest cigars is without a doubt the 94-rated Herrera Esteli. In 2016 we saw an offshoot of the blend produced at master Blender Willy Herrera’s former factory, El Titan de Bronze, in Miami in a tasty Corona Gorda size. At the 2018 IPCPR show the blend went full scale releasing four new sizes. The core of the blend consists of Dominican and Nicaraguan long-fillers that are bunched up entubar style – an old Cuban technique that is very labor intensive but provides a great draw. It’s all held together by leaves from Ecuador. A Sumatra-seed leaf is used for the binder while a dark Ecuador Habano Oscuro wrapper lays overtop, secured by a triple seam cap. It’s a smooth full-bodied blend with flavors sweet cedar, earth, and espresso. Whether you tried the original Corona Gorda or not, you should check out these new sizes. They’re only rolled by level 9 rollers from Cuba so you can count on high quality construction and the flavors are fantastic. Good news! Herrera Esteli Miami has earned an impressive 93-point rating, noting: ""A toothy toro with the rich qualities of semi-sweet chocolate, cedar and almonds. Hints of orange peel add a pleasant pop of citrus to the espresso bean finish.""",Medium-Full,"['Corona', 'Lonsdale', 'Pyramid', 'Robusto', 'Toro']",Sumatra,"Dominican, Nicaraguan",False,No,More Details,Nicaragua,No,,"Corona, Lonsdale, Pyramid, Robusto, Toro",No,"Ecuador Habano, Oscuro",Drew Estate Cigars
518,Drew Estate Herrera Esteli Norteno,Rated 5 out of 5, Based on 7 Ratings ,"Herrera Esteli’s sophomore effort lives up to the hype!Willy Herrera began his craft as a small manufacturer in Little Havana, Miami and his talents quickly landed him a job as Drew Estate’s master blender. Drafting off of the success of his first release under the Drew Estate umbrella, Herrera Esteli Norteno has finally arrived. This new release pays homage to Esteli, Nicaragua – the home of Drew Estate and Herrera Esteli. Norteno, meaning “northerners” in Spanish, was chosen as the name due to people from Esteli being referred to as ‘Nortenos.’This full-bodied firecracker is no joke, boasting long-fillers from the fertile Nicaraguan growing regions of Jalapa and Esteli, both known for producing bold n’ hearty tobaccos. A Honduran binder cloaks these leaves with an oily San Andres Maduro wrapper draped over top. This long-anticipated release delivers bold notes of pepper and chocolate that endure to the finish and are backed by hints of cashew, cocoa, and espresso. Powerful, ultra-flavorful, and satisfying to the last puff, the second Herrera is easily as good as the first. And if you’ve tried the original, you know that says a hell of a lot. Drew Estate Herrera Esteli Norteno landed at #7 on the 2016 Top 25 Cigar list and received a well-deserved 94-rating, noting: ""It’s also rich with notes of raw cocoa bean, refined milk chocolate and nougat, yet maintains its earthy qualities without becoming too sweet.""​NOTE: Drew Estate Herrera Esteli Norteno has undergone a packaging update.

The Yakuza are as famed for their intricate tattoos as their missing pinkies, and this new, bold blend from Gurkha, dubbed Yakuza, is as menacing as its namesake. A blend that’s as special as Gurkha Yakuza shouldn’t come in normal packaging, and leave it to Gurkha to knock this one out of the park. Coming dressed in a oil-oozing, milk-chocolaty Ecuador Habano ligero wrapper, Yakuza’s aesthetics are spot-on. A quick peak under the covers reveals a Nicaraguan binder embracing a collection of ligero-laced, uber-refined Nicaraguan and Honduran long-fillers with the addition of a small amount of La Entradas long-filler. Well-balanced, this firecracker is in-your-face full-bodied and will lay the smack-down in the flavor department. Bold notes of toast, oak, nuts, espresso, and pepper intertwine for a robust and dizzying experience. Not for the faint of heart, the Gurkha Yakuza will send you into sensory overload.

Nowadays, it seems like a lot of cigars focus on fancy bands, names, and advertisements. We all know you can't light up the band or that magazine spread. So, in an effort to allow the consumer to noodle just on the cigar, Heisenberg was born. Based on the Uncertainty Principle, which in layman's terms, means the more you think you know about one thing the less you will know about the other. So instead of coercing you with fancy packaging or a jazzed up theme, Heisenberg just delivers a straight-up, delicious cigar. I can't even give you any 411 on the blend, because there isn't any available. Think of it like a good mystery novel without a cover.

While aging, these cigars have been slowly infused with the delicious flavor of gourmet mocha, morphing a traditional Nicaraguan cigar into an incredibly rich cigar that burns smooth from start to finish, leaving an extremely pleasant aroma in its wake.What's this 'Latte' all about, you ask? The Java Latte employs a silky-smooth Connecticut Ecuador wrapper rather than the standard Connecticut Broadleaf. The result is a mellow and creamy sensation with all that Java awesomeness you've come to love.Note: The Wafe size is a flat-pressed cigar that measures roughly one-third of an inch thick when laid flat. ",,"['Cigarillos', 'Corona', 'Gordo', 'Petite Corona', 'Robusto', 'Toro']",,Nicaraguan,True,No,More Details,Nicaragua,Varies,,"Cigarillos, Corona, Gordo, Petite Corona, Robusto, Toro",Yes,"Brazilian, Ecuador Connecticut, Maduro",Drew Estate Cigars

Today, Joya de Nicaragua lends us a hand in answering this age old question, with the release of Antano Gran Reserva. Modeled after their flagship Antano line, Gran Reserva is a similar blend, with the addition of aged tobaccos to provide a more “mature” experience. Manufactured at Joya de Nicaragua’s operation in Esteli, Nicaragua, Joya de Nicaragua Antano Gran Reserva is a Nicaraguan puro of the highest caliber. To set this one apart from its peers, Juan Martinez (Executive President of JdN), called for the addition of five-year-aged filler leaves to the mix and applied a rich and oily Corojo wrapper on top. The result is markedly different from the regular Antano: what was once a powerful, unabashed beast has been tamed, offering a much smoother ride. There’s still hits of black pepper up front, but they’re quickly joined by natural, sugary sweetness, nutty notes, and dry chocolate. Good News! Joya De Nicaragua Antano Gran Reserva has been awarded as the #16 best cigar of 2018 and earned an awesome 93-point rating, noting: ""this attractive cigar has a pleasantly toasty core that's elevated by hints of saffron, hickory wood and chocolate.

Like brave knights coming to battle a fearsome dragon, many enthusiasts have entered the fray confident, only to be quickly tamed by bold, powerful profiles. I've seen it all too many times. We even had a guy pass out while using the facilities at one of our stores....he was puffing on it like a locomotive stuck on overdrive. Luckily, after about a 5 minute tile nap, he exited with just a bruised ego. He, like many before him, learned that Joya de Nicaragua makes one hell of a full-bodied cigar. But now, Joya de Nicaragua dials the strength down a bit for a cigar that's built for daily enjoyment. Without any further delay welcome, JOYA Red. Many of Joya de Nicaragua's handmades rely on potent ligeros to deliver their feisty bouquet. This time, lower tobacco primings were chosen to impart the same core flavors, but in a much more palatable fashion. Long-fillers from the uber-fertile regions of Esteli, Condega, and Jalapa, were stuffed into a golden hued Nicaraguan Habano wrapper.

Newman’s top-selling cigar was a little brand known as “Judge Wright.” Back then, the line had a simple slogan, “A fair trial will give a verdict in favor of this cigar.” Now, I’ve got to be honest. My experience with any sort of court is limited to Judge Judy and Law and Order reruns. However, if I were a judge, I’d throw anyone who didn’t like this cigar out, as they must be insane. This cigar is a straight up value, and I’d recommend getting in early and often. Judge Wright is a Nicaraguan puro with a Sun Grown wrapper, but unlike some similar blends, this one stays smooth and medium-bodied throughout. The ‘Cuban sandwich’ blend has great flavors of earth, leather, and slight spice. There’s nothing else I can say here, Judge Wright is a great everyday cigar.

902,La Aurora ADN Dominicano,Rated 5 out of 5, Based on 1 Rating ,"It’s in the DNALa Aurora is one of the oldest cigar manufacturers in the business. So it’s no surprise that they have perfected the oldest tobacco-processing technique and put it to good use in the La Aurora ADN. This process is Andullo tobacco. Instead of the tobacco being placed in the usual pilones (large piles or rotating tobacco), Andullo tobacco is made by taking the harvested tobacco and then wrapping it up into large pods that are then rooted into the ground. This tobacco is typically used in pipe tobacco and is known for its strength, aroma, and sweetness. ADN Dominicano was crafted to honor the special Andullo tobacco, but it actually uses tobaccos from a few different countries. The wrapper is a chocolate brown Dominican leaf from the Cibao Valley while a Camerron binder holds long-fillers from Pennsylvania and Nicaragua, as well as a full leaf of Domincan Andullo. It’s full-bodied but never overpowering with notes of chocolate, spice, some woodsy notes, and a pleasant sweetness. This unique offering is definitely worth a try. Good news, La Aurora ADN Dominicano has received an impressive 90-point rating, noting: “The spicy, woody notes of this cigar meld pleasantly with hints of sweetness that segue into a graham cracker finish.

The wrapper is Dominican Corojo that has undergone several fermentation processes to produce a maduro shade. This further mellows the blend, allowing it to tame the complex mixture of Dominican and Nicaraguan long-fillers inside. La Aurora Barrel Aged is a medium-to full-bodied cigar layered with rich tobacco flavors. You’ll pick up a sweet spice upon first light and towards the nub, with a rich, chewy, and toasty bouquet in between.

The samples smell great, the cigars we were sent disappeared very quickly, so survey says this one’s gonna be a surefire hit. What’s in the blend? A Mexican San Andres Maduro wrapper hugs Dominican binder and filler grown from La Flor Dominicana’s own factory and farm. The wrapper almost oozes with oils, and gives off a potent bouquet. Lighting it up, you’ll get chocolate and molasses, with a sharp citrus-y note and some black pepper on the finish.

929,La Flor Dominicana Andalusian Bull,Rated 4.58 out of 5, Based on 12 Ratings ,"The #1 Cigar of 2016!This award winning blend comes from the mind of master-blender Litto Gomez. Born in Spain, Litto gives a nod to his homeland with arguably the best release to ever come out of the La Flor Dominicana camp (and that’s saying a whole lot), dubbed Andalusian Bull. Striking in its appearance, the Bull gets its unique, old-school shape from a long-since-retired cigar mold that Gomez tracked down in Belgium. Coming in one size only, a rustic-looking figurado, this gem takes you back to the golden age of cigars.A beautiful, reddish-hued Ecuadorian Corojo wrapper is first to grab your attention. (There have been very few times I knew a cigar was going to rock my world just by looking at it…this was one of those occasions.) Potent Dominican filler tobaccos including Criollo ’98 and Pelo d’Oro are hugged by a Dominican binder. The unique figurado shape lends itself to a truly complex experience. The thickest part of the Bull is at the foot of the cigar, and introduces a myriad of flavors from the get-go. Caramel, leather, and a tinge of milk chocolate kick things off, with notes of sweet spice, rich red pepper, and slight citrus nuances entering the fray as the ring gauge gradually decreases. In this case, I’m happy to report this sucker deserves its #1 Cigar of the Year honors and then some, get ‘em the very first chance you get!La Flor Dominicana was awarded with #1 Cigar of 2016 honors and a well-deserved 96-rating! Here’s what the experts had to say, “First impressions are bold and savory with strong notes of hickory and leather. But it continues to take on a complex spiciness of saffron and cumin as well as a slight tangy note that brings the strength and spice together quite gracefully—and it only gets better with every puff.”Note: As a result of Andalusian Bull's recent praise and honors, the factory is experiencing an extended backlog. At this point, lead times on filling new customer backorders may be up to 1 year. Due to the extended delay, we will not be accepting any further backorders until production increases.

While the blends are incredibly varied, there is one thing in common: LFD’s got kick. Like, championship level kick-boxing strength behind it. It all comes from their generous use of ligero long-fillers, and in the cigars at hand today, that leaf takes center-stage. If you’re not a fan of full-bodied cigars, I’d suggest taking yourself elsewhere post-haste. But if you want a boutique boomstick that’ll demand your taste bud’s full attention, stand up.

La Galera 1936 Box Pressed cigars were released in 2016, but the planning for these cigars first started 7 years prior. When Jochy decided he was going to create a premium line of cigars of his own, he took some of the finest tobaccos he had grown on his La Canela farms and set them aside to age for 7 years. These were Piloto Cubano and Criollo 98 leaves that are used in the filler and another Criollo 98 as the binder. To finish the blend off he applied a smooth Ecuador Habano wrapper on top. The blend is medium to full in body, with a ton of great flavor. Notes of cocoa, pepper, dried fruit, espresso, and earth make for a satisfying complexity. It’s hard to find cigars of this quality in this price range, try out a fiver and I’m sure you’ll be back for a box. Good news!

La Gloria Cubana Serie R. A 92-rated, full-bodied treat packed with a four country blend of Dominican, Nicaraguan, Brazilian and Mexican long-fillers. These cigars first hit the market back in 1999 and have seen much success. In 2003, celebrating the 5th anniversary of the cigar, Carrillo debuted the Serie R Limitada Series. These are made in limited quantities every year using a different blend that will never be revisited. The Limitada 2005 comes in your choice of Connecticut Broadleaf or Ecuador Sumatra wrapper over Nicaraguan binder and long-fillers from the Dominican and Nicaragua. It comes in one hefty size at almost 8"" long with a thick 62 ring gauge providing over 2 hours of enjoyment. Only 700 boxes were produced in each wrapper and they come packaged inside an Italian handcrafted humidor made especially for this release.

Instead of using molds to press cigars before placing them in a box, the box-press was achieved by simply placing cigars in specially-sized boxes that would apply even pressure to the cigars, resulting in a more even box-press that eliminated air pockets and guaranteed an excellent draw. This was known as a “Spanish Press”, and the Spanish Press by La Gloria Cubana is the perfect tribute to this classic style.The La Gloria Cubana Sapnish Press features a toothy Nicaraguan Jalapa wrapper, brimming with flavors that perfectly compliment the San Andres binder and tri-country filler blend consisting of Nicaraguan Jalapa, Dominican Piloto Cubano, Dominican Olor, and Brazilian Mata Fina tobacco. Along with a great draw and smoke production, you’ll find spicy earthiness and notes of cedar and toast. This release is an excellent addition to La Gloria Cubana’s portfolio, and a terrific way to honor the roots of an important genre of cigars.

Because you’re here and because I would never dream of making you spend one shiny nickel more than you need to, White Pearl is generously discounted and offered up for way less than it’s worth.An Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper leaf enshrouds a Sumatran binder, and the whole shebang is completed by the generous addition of Honduran and Nicaraguan filler, including just enough ligero to deliver a little kick. The flavors are complex, yet maintain that smooth and creamy character that’s reminiscent of a much costlier brand.

Born in Cuba, AJ began working with tobacco at a very young age, studying under some of the industry's most legendary minds. After years absorbing knowledge, Abdel moved to Nicaragua 6 years ago and began building what is now emerging as one of the finest boutique makers in the country.Of all the cigars made in his factory – ITC 10th Anniversary, Padilla Habano, Rocky Patel Fusion – Abdel considers the Man O’ War his finest creation. Each expertly made cigar is a sight to behold. The dark Habano Ecuador wrapper is beautiful...thick, smooth, and covered with natural oils. This thing is stunning, positively gorgeous. But underneath the velvet glove is a hammer, a robust medium-full recipe of aged Cuban-seed Nicaraguan long-fillers which unleashes a bold bouquet for the senses. The opening is robust, with heavy spice and wood undertones, developing a chewy, velvety-smooth core of oak and earth which coats the palate, leaving behind a sweet array of spices. A variety of understated nuances come and go throughout the burn, including coffee, cocoa bean, and a touch of vanilla. Man O' War is simply incredible. I mean it. The packaging for Man O’ War is suitably impressive, a presentation to match the quality of the cigar itself. 22 Man O' War cigars snugly packed in a unique, heavy cedar chest.",Medium-Full,"['Corona', 'Double Corona', 'Figurado', 'Robusto', 'Toro', 'Torpedo']",,Nicaraguan,False,No,More Details,Nicaragua,No,,"Corona, Double Corona, Figurado, Robusto, Toro, Torpedo",No,Ecuador Habano,Man O' War
1054,Man O' War Armada,Rated 4.72 out of 5, Based on 39 Ratings ,"Worth. Every. Penny.A $20 cigar runs counter to every fiber of the deep discounting instinct that runs through CI Nation's red blood. Many expensive cigars are simply 3-dollar sticks with a 10-dollar bill wrapped around it. But from time to time such a price tag is warranted…. expensive because they're actually, well, expensive. Extra care, extra long processes and extra steps during production, extra aging and optimum fermentation, extra rare and costly tobaccos and materials. Man O’ War Armada is all that and more. The price is nauseatingly steep, but boy-oh-boy are you getting something special. It's a special, personal blend of cigar master and Man O’ War maker A.J. Fernandez. A tasty elixir draped in a dark, toothy, Ecuador-Sumatra wrapper leaf and bringing a full-frontal assault of flavor: complexity like you read about, an eruption of Cuban-esque power yet nicely balanced, over-the-top notes of earth, vanilla, coffee, spices, and cedar with a crisp tobacco core.

The $100 per cigar price tag may sound a little steep, but once you get one of these beauties in your hand, you won't regret a single penny.For the blend, Saka sorted through 6000 pounds of Connecticut Broadleaf wrapper and Nicaraguan filler, with only one percent being deemed high enough quality to make it into the finished product. The double perfecto shape was achieved by hardwood molds hand-cut by Saka himself, and production of the cigars themselves was entrusted to just one buncher-roller duo in the entire factory. Its rare that a cigar with such a high price point has a flavor profile good enough to match, but the Muestra de Saka Unicorn delivers in spades. pumping out an unbelievably complex yet medium-bodied profile with notes of cocoa, espresso, and a pleasant caramel sweetness supporting a core of roasted nuts, fresh-baked bread, and a touch of black pepper. The cost of admission is high, but with production limited to just 1000 cigars, you'll be kicking yourself if you miss your chance to pick yourself up a true Unicorn.Click Here to view the rest of the Dunbarton Tobacco & Trust portfolio",Medium-Full,['Perfecto'],,Nicaraguan,False,No,More Details,Nicaragua,No,,Perfecto,No,Connecticut Broadleaf,Dunbarton Tobacco & Trust

That said, here’s the skinny.Genesis is a small-batch super-premium, meticulously hand-crafted by Ramon Bueso in Honduras. Who is Ramon Bueso? Trust me when I tell you he isn’t some ho-hum street corner vendor. Quite the opposite, in fact, Ramon has been an integral player in the cigar industry for nearly 4 decades. Since 1977, Ramon has been honing his mastery of cigars and has perfected every facet of cigar production. From grower to roller to master-blender to factory supervisor. Early in his career, Ramon Bueso was vital in catapulting the legendary Villazon factory to new heights, working alongside cigar legends Frank Llaneza and Estelo Padron, and producing some of the world’s biggest and most successful blends in the process. Blends you enjoy early and often, from the likes of Hoyo de Monterrey, Excalibur, Punch, and so much more.Truth is, Ramon’s mind and hands have created more brands and blends than one can accurately count, let alone imagine. But this....this is by far his most irresistible creation yet. His raison d’etre, if you will. Genesis began as ‘The Project,’ a limited production, local favorite exclusive to the Honduran market, mostly used for gifts and events. Now available on a grander scale, the Genesis is ready to make its mark. The lush, well-aged tobaccos used to craft Genesis deliver a scrumptious and complex medium to full-bodied bouquet. An exceedingly complex core of vintage long-fillers from Nicaragua and Honduras, including select ligeros, visos, and secos. This complex recipe is expertly blended, secured inside a feisty Jamastran binder, then cloaked by a dark and inviting, triple-fermented Connecticut Broadleaf maduro wrapper boasting gorgeous oils. From the very first puff, it’s clear this cigar is something special. Each Genesis wastes no time asserting its distinct array of eventful profile. Thick and creamy flavor coats the palate, dusting the taste buds with hearty notes of espresso, roasted nuts, earth, and nutmeg. The finish is long and savory, offering a unique spicy-sweetness after each puff. Complex, yet highly refined and skillfully balanced, Genesis is a mere peak into the window of Ramon Bueso’s extraordinary talents.

1342,Ramon Bueso Olancho Vintage,Rated 4.37 out of 5, Based on 261 Ratings ,"​Dare I say, crowning achievement?Although it’s only been a few years since Ramon Bueso’s first project, it feels like I’ve been waiting for decades. I, like many of you, am a huge fan of Bueso’s other blends. Genesis is still in my regular rotation, and there are few things finer than an Odyssey paired with a hot mug of coffee. But I’m greedy, and I want more. Well, finally, that wait is over. Ramon Bueso Olancho Vintage is here, and burning one of these feels like coming home from a long trip.This is the cigar that Ramon always wanted to make, and his passion really shines through. All of the tobaccos in this blend are absolutely flawless, aged, handpicked leaves, with each cigar receiving personalized attention and care. So what's in this recipe? We've got an aged 2005 binder leaf from Talanga Valley, and a wide variety of long-filler leaves including selections from 2008 Nicaraguan Esteli, 2010 Honduras La Entrada, 2008 Honduran Jamastran, and 2003 Honduras Olancho. On top of all of that, the wrapper is a Colorado Oscuro Olancho, grown exclusively for this cigar. These leaves were purposefully fermented for a shorter amount of time than industry standard, and the experiment paid off with an absolutely unique flavor unlike any other cigar on the market. Lighting this one up, I find a medium to full-bodied blend with blasts of earth, spice, leather, and cedar in a harmony that feels different than anything I’ve burnt before. Each cigar this guy puts out tastes better than the last, and with Olancho Vintage, we’re seeing Ramon’s finest work to date. I’d easily recommend this cigar to any enthusiast. Stock up, because with the rarity of these fine leaves, this is one limited release you absolutely don’t want to miss out on. ​",Medium-Full,"['Gordo', 'Presidente', 'Robusto', 'Toro', 'Torpedo']",Honduran,"Honduran, Nicaraguan",False,No,More Details,Honduras,No,,"Gordo, Presidente, Robusto, Toro, Torpedo",No,Habano,Ramon Bueso
1343,Ramones Connecticut,Rated 3.83 out of 5, Based on 12 Ratings ,"Mellow in body, smooth in flavorIf there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that finding a bargain is awesome. Draft specials at baseball games, discounted tee times, slightly “scratch and dent” but otherwise perfectly fine humidors. I live for the deal. Maybe that’s how I ended up a staffer at Camp CI. Either way, my favorite deal is finding a perfect everyday smooth blend. Ramones Connecticut delivers, and it delivers in spades. Let’s take a peek under the sheets and figure out what we’re working with here. An Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper is flawlessly applied over mix-fillers from the Dominican Republic, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The Indonesian Sumatra binder lends a natural sweetness to this otherwise creamy, slightly spicy blend. Oh, I almost forgot the best part! Ramones Connecticut is manufactured by Camacho.

1346,Renzulli,Rated 5 out of 5, Based on 8 Ratings ,"A taste of PhillyFresh from the streets of Philly – the City of Brotherly Love – comes a prince of a cigar, dubbed Renzulli. A small batch, boutique blend, Renzulli exhibits its premium character at first glance. A mouthwatering, chocolate brown wrapper grabs your attention, and on closer examination you’ll find the stick is well-filled without any visible seams. Crafted at Erik Espinosa’s heralded boutique La Zona factory in Esteli, Nicaragua, this medium to full-bodied cigar hits the palate like a flavor bomb. Graced with a Habano Rosado wrapper hugging a hearty blend of Nicaraguan long-fillers, Renzulli delivers an onslaught of flavors that will keep you entertained. Much like the famous Rocky training montage, this cigar packs punches of earth, leather, spice, cocoa, and a slight sweetness to keep you on your toes. And just a quick note on the sizes. Each of these is named for Philly and Italian slang. Cing U Bezz  translates to five dollars a piece, ""cuz"" is slang for cousin, minchia means ""wow!"", and as any Sopranos fan knows, a goomad is a mistress, or a girlfriend.

The cigar, for those who aren’t familiar, was a great medium-full bodied blend, one that consistently performed time and time again. Sadly, REO became a casualty of business disputes. With three different industry titans involved in the making of this handmade, there were simply too many mouths to feed. Partnerships severed, and REO went the way of the dinosaurs. However, it was always the brain child of Eddie Ortega, and finally, he's brought this delicious premium back for all to enjoy.At hand today is the rereleased REO, back and better than ever. An oily maduro wrapper is draped over Honduran and Nicaraguan long-fillers to create a tasty handmade that can be enjoyed any day (especially at these prices). Pair it up with a hot cup of coffee, or a cold glass of rum, and enjoy the slightly sweet, coffee and chocolate dominant profile. If anything is an indication of how great this rerelease is, it's how quickly the samples ""disappeared"" from our offices.

Rare. Ask any master blender or grower what the secret to a great cigar is, and 9 times out of 10 they’ll tell you the same thing: “You can’t rush tobacco.” Indeed, when you cut corners in the aging process, you can certainly get a good cigar but you’ll never get something truly outstanding. Rocky took that lesson to heart with the creation of A.L.R., a single-batch release of 100,000 sticks that’s been patiently aging for the last three years. Rolled back in 2016, this silky and complex medium-bodied cigar is truly decadent. The result is a complexity that you won’t find on most cigars, with layers of flavor coming through on every puff. Cocoa and earth mingles with slight hints of black pepper and roasted coffee, while the finish is surprisingly sweet and smooth — truly, one of the best Rocky blends I’ve ever tried, you’d best do yourself a favor and grab a box of these while you can. ",Medium,['Robusto'],,,False,No,More Details,Nicaragua,No,,Robusto,No,Ecuador Habano,

Crafted in celebration of the 10th anniversary of one of Mr. Patel’s most coveted lines, The Edge, A-10 is nothing short of a showstopper. The Edge initially hit shelves in 2004. A-10 was the result of intense hard work and effort, as Rocky demanded only the best tobaccos adorn this anniversary blend.

Refined notes of sweet spice and leather can be found stemming from the maduro wrapper, with hints of black pepper and earth appearing as a result of the Corojo wrapper.

1412,Rocky Patel Vintage 2nds,Rated 4.49 out of 5, Based on 449 Ratings ,"Thanks to minor cosmetic blemishes, Rock Patel’s Vintage 2nds cigars are a steal!It’s amazing, really, to watch the success of Rocky Patel’s new blends over the past two years. You’ve got to admire him. Initially hailed for his innovative, full-throttle Indian Tabac cigars in the late 90’s, yet just a few years later Rocky was cast aside as an outsider by most of the clubby cigar makers, the usual suspects claiming to be superior because of their “3 bazillion years in the business,” and “100 generations of family experience” in tobacco. But Rocky just kept plugging away, the hardest working man in the business – a guy who is on the road constantly, visiting even the tiniest of retail shops and working countless days in the factories of Danli, Honduras. In fact, I’ve been with him numerous times to Honduras; it is a sight to watch him relentlessly push for perfection, driving everyone in the factory nuts, single-mindedly devoted to crafting a great product. So it’s good to see things come full circle for him, garnering a slew of 90+ ratings and high praise from all who sample his blends.Particularly good are his RP Vintage cigars. And particularly special is this deal. You see, his rate of rejection is much higher than average, thus a small mountain of “Seconds” has been accumulating in the factory. These Seconds are labeled as such because they have been rejected strictly for cosmetic reasons. The wrappers are a little splotchy here or have a slight discoloration there.

With this stogie, RoMa Craft Tabac says enough is enough. It’s time to rise up, and start the contemporary intemperance movement. And there’s no better way to start, than with a premium cigar in hand. The Intemperance line comes in two distinct wrappers, and at hand today is the B.A. version. Named after the oily Brazilian Arapiraca wrapper that coats this handmade, this medium bodied blend pushes flavor to the absolute limits. Notes of tangy BBQ, charred meat, leather, and earth join a natural sweetness that’ll keep you coming back for more, time and time again. And you don’t need to worry about construction, every sample of this stick I burnt was razor-sharp. Light up the Intemperance BA, and let our government know: we’ve had it.   Good news, RoMa Craft Intemperance BA XXI has earned an awesome 90-point rating, noting; ""Rolled with a dark wrapper that doesn't quite reach the foot of the cigar, this robusto has a lush draw that delivers notes of oak wood and earth before sweeter hints of caramel come through.""",Medium-Full,"['Belicoso', 'Perfecto', 'Petite Corona', 'Robusto']",Indonesian,"Dominican, Nicaraguan",False,False,More Details,Nicaragua,No,,"Belicoso, Perfecto, Petite Corona, Robusto",No,Brazilian,

Indeed, every brand AJ touches turns to gold, and Altadis has clearly picked up on this. Not familiar with the Altadis name? They’re the brains behind brands like Montecristo, Romeo y Julieta, and H. Upmann, and in the last few years they’ve been working with AJ to produce some amazingly delicious blends. Case in point? The Romeo y Julieta RyJ Nicaragua – another beautiful entry in this collaborative story. For this latest collaboration between Altadis, USA and AJ Fernandez, AJ utilized a beautiful Nicaraguan Habano 2000 wrapper leaf. This Nicaraguan puro is a beautifully produced powerhouse blend, delivering waves of espresso, black pepper, cedar and earth as it burns slowly to the nub. As for performance?

A luxurious Connecticut shade wrapper grown under natural cloud cover in Ecuador sits atop a Mexican Matacapan Negro de Temporal binder, with a carefully selected Nicaraguan filler blend. The flavors are all classic Connecticut, with extra complexity and refinement that can only come from the high-quality ingredients hand-selected by Saka himself.

The Nicaraguan filler from the original is accompanied by Dominican tobacco, and a good amount of ligero was included to appease any double-ligero lovers out there. When fire meets Brimstone, you can expect a blast of spicy-yet-smooth flavors of pepper, cedar, earth, and espresso.

Well now the curtain has been lifted, and Caldwell is showing off their latest creation, one that’s not even made by Caldwell in the first place.Collaboration is important in the cigar industry, and so is tasting what the other guys are producing. So when AJ Fernandez lit up a King is Dead, he got some ideas of what he would do different with the blend. It’s not that there was anything wrong with it, on the contrary, it’s an excellent cigar. But AJ felt that it deserved a Nicaraguan interpretation, a re-working of the blend using all limited Nicaraguan wrapper. The maduro wrapper and aged filler blend produce a full-bodied profile that stays true to the original, but provides an entirely new experience with spicy, earthy notes of leather and cedar.

Spanish for “The Wise Man,” Gueguense is actually pronounced similar to “way-when-say.” But enough about that, let’s talk tobacco. The wrapper leaf here is a toothy beast, utilizing a San Andres Mexican Maduro wrapper to the fullest extent. Melillo selected this leaf specifically to create a line that offered a whole different level of complexity, and he most certainly achieves that goal. Lighting up The Wise Man Maduro, you’ll find sharp notes of black pepper, soft cocoa, and rich coffee. If you’re a fan of rich maduros, you better try Wise Man Maduro today. The Wise Man Maduro has earned an impressive 95-point rating and was named the #3 Cigar of 2018, noting ""It’s a flavorful blend that oscillates between the sweet and the savory.

You're still going to have the traditional BBQ tanginess, smoky wood, and sweet chocolate notes that Kentucky fired-cured is known for mixed with some red pepper notes that brings both a sweet, and spicy, medium-bodied experience to your palate.
